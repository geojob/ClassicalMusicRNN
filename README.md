# MOCA LSTM Music Generation -jb4512

Overall Structure of the REPO:

	|---Jupyter Notebook file (showing some interactive parts of the project including file mounting as well as model architecture)
	|
	|--- data.py (auxilary data reading functions)
	|
	|---midi_to_statematrix (functions that change midi files to state matrices and vice versa)
	|
	|---multi-training(functions that allow loading of batches and training of the data)
	|
	|---RNNModel (the main architecture file)
	|
	|---music
	|	---all the MIDI files used for training
	|
	|---midi
	|	---util files that are required for a few of the root files (the files are available online as python-midi)
	|
	|---output
	|	---a few of the best and worst samples produced by the architecture
	|
	|---model
	|	---some of the models that were saved during the training process based on loss value
